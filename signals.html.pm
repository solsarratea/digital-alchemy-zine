    Using filters?
        ◊b[#:class "shadow big"]{context!} << oohhhhhh!!!


    difference between data and information –



    ◊span[#:class "shadow big"]{ data}
    ◊b{◊span[#:class "ver shadow mid"]{as just constant random input}}


    and


    ◊span[#:class "shadow big"]{ information}
    ◊b{◊span[#:class "ver shadow mid"]{as data  organised and contextualised to express something}}


    i like the idea of context of comparing based on scale / relative size, even like a context of a different software /   ◊b{◊span[#:class "ver shadow mid"]{ trying to open files in software they weren't meant to be opened }}  in, the medium of it reminds me of obsolete devices/technologies


      ◊b{◊span[#:class "shadow"]{ perception is all about the receiver?}}
        adding randomness or uncertainty, filtering (eg Kalman filters), probability, adding events prior and after the one we are looking at (eg posterior probability)

            projecting images to some distorted surface seem fun to try or even blocking some parts of it for different silhouettes on top of the projected image
            if we can somehow incorporate smell with data I think that would be cool ^agree

recreating ◊b{Synthesizers }


Does playing a karaoke version of a song on youtube and singing on top of it count as synthesizing analog and digital sounds? lol

I definitely only really think of music. I don't jump to other forms of media when hearing this, ◊b{◊span[#:class "shadow2 mid"]{ but when you relate it to digital matter, then i stop thinking of music and think of waves.}}

                                                                                                                                                                We saw in the first session how waves, or   ◊b{◊span[#:class " shadow2 mid blue"]{ frequencies }}  can be applied to more than sound, with the JPEG compression stuff.

My first thought with the word synthesis is sound, the act of synthesizing sound
putting things together maybe sound and image? 

                                                                                                                                                                ◊b{◊span[#:class " mid"]{ Modular}}
