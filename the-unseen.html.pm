I think of it as  ◊b[#:class "shadow big"]{layers}; so there are seen layers and hidden (like ◊b[#:class "ver shadow2" ]{hidden} files and ones that are ◊b[#:class "ver shadow2" ]{visible})

What tools can we use to help us percieve? we are able to percieve more and more as time goes on.

◊section{INNER STRUCTURE OF DATA}

 ◊span{I think about  ◊b[#:class "shadow mid"]{different 'messages' in different mediums} what changes/what stays the same
e.g. translating across languages, now translating between text/image/sound via code...◊b[#:class "shadow2 mid"]{ what structures this message so that it can remain similar between translations?} idk!}

◊p{
◊b[#:class "shadow2 mid"]{ keys, values,}  ◊b[#:class " big glow"]{bits}

◊b[#:class "shadow big blue"]{some schema}

 ◊b[#:class "shadow2 mid cyan"]{states: either particles or waves} probabilities, odds with degrees of noise based on uncertainty. It's temporal-spatial (particularly for quantum)
to us, perception may be all. But not in the absolute
ques in my mind: are we a perception :)

I love the  ◊b[#:class "shadow mid"]{frequencies} part of the first session, so i assume most  ◊b[#:class "shadow ver big"]{data}, specifically in music and files, can be represented as waves.
