This ◊b{place} would become our alive wiki thoughout the course.

So.. what about  ◊i{◊b{the course}}?

It is a series of  experimental workshops for understanding low level representation of information without requiring a formal computer-science background.

◊b{WHY?}

Interpretation of information plays a central role in making sense of the world. What if there were different ways of decoding the data around us? For computers, is everything represented in binary digits? Are bits analogous to matter?

Are we aware of what data is in our digital days? How is it encoded and decoded? How much do we rely on these for making sense of digital spaces?

Imagine you could explore transmutation of data and play around with boundaries of creation/representation. If we write poetry, but we are creating visual art and that is the final piece. Are we writers? Are we visual artists?
