◊span[#:class "ver"]{Digital} Alchemy is an  ◊span[#:class "cross"]{ancient} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{modern}  metaphysical science | mystical art of manipulating and altering ◊span[#:class "cross"]{matter} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{bits} by using ◊span[#:class "cross"]{natural energy} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{algorithms, parsers and file formats}.

This act is known as ◊b{Transmutation}  and its sequence is usually described as:

◊b{Comprehension} - Understanding the inherent structure and properties of the atomic or molecular makeup of a particular  ◊span[#:class "cross"]{material} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{data representation} to be transmuted, including the flow and balance of ◊span[#:class "cross"]{ potential and kinetic energy} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{compression algorithms, encoders and specifications} within.

◊b{Deconstruction} - Using  ◊span[#:class "cross"]{energy} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{parsers|decoders} to break down the physical structure of the identified  ◊span[#:class "cross"]{material} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{format} into a more malleable state so as to be easily reshaped into a new form.

◊b{Reconstruction} - Continuing the  ◊span[#:class "cross"]{flow of energy} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{usage of algorithms}  so as to reform the  ◊span[#:class "cross"]{material} ◊span[#:class "ver"]{data}  into a new shape.
